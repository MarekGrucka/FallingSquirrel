# Falling Squirrel
This project started from a discussion with colleagues about what would happen if a squirrel free-fell from 1000 km. 
Some argued that squirrel will burn from friction, other that it will not as it's very light and air drag will quickly slow it down.
To find out the answer I decided to create web application that simulates this. 
As I found out, this task is not so easy, as there are a lot of fenomena depending on each other to find the correct solutions. 
To test the simulation model I plug the values of know free falls- for example measured terminal velocity of squirrel, 
terminal velocity of people in horizontal and vertical position and free fall of Felix Baumgartner. 
The results are quite acurate but still I need to improve temperature modeling and implement some graphic elements and falling squirrel animations.

Project created using Angular.
